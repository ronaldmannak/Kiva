Tsiala doesn't have her own job, but she puts much effort in her agricultural business. Particularly, she cultivates nuts and takes care of her vineyard. She gets her income from selling agricultural products in the local market, and always has high quality products and her own costumers. This hard-working couple does everything to provide financial stability for their children, but their business needs investments to make more profits and increase productivity. \r\n\r\nTsiala has a great desire to expand her agribusiness and start dairy farming. That's why she requested a loan and was approved for the amount of 1,500 GEL. She plans to purchase a cow and after that she will produce milk products and start selling it locally. They also use the milk products for family feeding. \r\n\r\nTsiala will be grateful for the help and will highly appreciate it.

Milena conoce muy bien como estimular el buen comportamiento delos niños, pues estudió para ello, además de ser madre de una niña de 1 año.

Today, 3 years later, she works every workday from 2 until 5 in the afternoon. She has a goal in the future: open a school and have more students every day, which is her biggest challenge. Right now, she is applying for a Kiva loan with the Fundación Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy children's chairs and candies to make the children's stay pleasant. Milena knows very well how to encourage good behavior from children. She studied for it and she is the mother of a 1 year old girl. Her investment will generate improvements for her business. It will potentialize the influx of new children into her academic reinforcement classroom, making her Kiva loan a successful investment.

He didn't have the opportunity to go to school since when he was a boy he lived in a distant rural area and there no type of government services were provided. He is now partnered and has a daughter who works in a clinic as a nurse.  \r\n\r\nHe has worked practically his entire life in agriculture. When he was young, he planted corn and beans but he worked a lot and didn't get the earnings he hoped for. Now he works cultivating jícama, and has worked with this for 5 years.  It requires fewer costs and work, since one only has to be very attentive at the time of sowing and to check the crop for infestations.  \r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to plant two hectares of jícama since last year it gave an excellent agricultural production. This year he is already preparing to sow and needs to rent the land that he will cultivate and the rest of the money will be invested in purchasing seeds for sowing, fertilizer, and liquid fertilizers to spread on the leaves, among other items. \r\n\r\nDavid plans to be able to purchase some oxen to bring the needed things to the land where he grows jícama, in addition they will serve him to earn extra money since water shortage is very frequent where he lives and people pay in order to bring water to their homes. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":25,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1610945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","theme":"Rural Exclusion","use":"to plant two hectares of jícama and to purchase seeds to sew, fertilizer, and liquid fertilizers to spread on the leaves, among other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-06-03T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-07-03T13:00:04Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":714655,"name":"Marcos Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marco es un pequeño productor de café que vive con su esposa y sus dos hijos, en una comunidad al norte de Nicaragua.

Because it is hard for her family to survive if only her husband is working, she decided to engage herself in selling.  She started a sari-sari (mini-grocery) store with starting capital of 3,000 PHP. The store's primary customers are Sarah's neighbors. Happily, Sarah was able to manage the store well, and she covered the daily needs of her family with the help of Paglaum Cooperative. She was able to access previous loans, all of which she repaid religiously. Now, she applies for a loan to restock her store with basic inventory. She is looking forward to expanding her sari-sari into a Mini-mart someday.

for those in the Marines and the Navy.  These wooden paddles are wrapped with various colored cords and engraved with custom emblems to make the perfect award or retirement gift for those in the military.  These meaningful mementos were such huge hits that Anthony decided to turn his art of paddle-making into a business. \r\n\r\nAnthony's business is one of the few commemorative military paddle-makers in the world. Anthony treats his creations as unique works of art, taking time and patience to ensure his customers are truly receiving a one-of-a-kind gift. He currently makes everything himself, taking pride in his carefully detailed craftsmanship.  \r\n\r\nRecently, Anthony received a proposal letter from a local military base asking him to come in and become a permanent vendor on base, which is a huge opportunity for this budding entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nAnthony will use his $3,500 Kiva loan to build out his new shop and purchase new equipment, including a laser engraver and other miscellaneous tools to create even more specialty products for his customers on base.\r\n\r\nAnthony has high hopes for his business and believes he has found the perfect niche for his talents.

Some of his relatives like to purchase from his general store. He speaks with a monotonous tone, which is impressive and he easily wins the trust of others. Due to his behavior and tone, he has built up a very good relationship with his customers. His general store is very famous in the town and that is the reason his business is running well. Due to good relationships, his sales have increased a lot, but he does not have sufficient stock to cope with the demand. Therefore, Asma requested a loan for her husband so that he can buy more stocks of wheat, rice, flour, pulses, soaps, shampoo, detergents, biscuits, etc. Asma hopes that her husband will utilize the loan in a positive way; this amount will help him to cope with the demand of her family.

He is the only one responsible for feeding the entire family and managing the household.\r\n\r\nHe needs to purchase different types of clothes in bulk for reselling, but due to insufficient financial means he is unable to purchase these clothes. Therefore Sobia is applying for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can assist her husband in purchasing these clothes in bulk for his business. He can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount. \r\n\r\nSobia is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1614745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
